
function [COUNTSn] =  suavgausiano(COUNTS,w)
    %This function implements the gaussian smooth for an histogram an then it
    %can be used to find the thershold. It uses the COUNTS variable that is
    %returned by the imhist funcion an w is the size of the window that you
    %want to use. It has to be a odd number. if not, the funcion will not run
    %properly.
    %Typical application:
    %           I=imread('blood1','tiff');
    %           [COUNTS,x]=imhist(I);
    %           COUNTSn=suavgausiano(COUNTS,3);
    %Where COUNTSn is the new COUNTS variable that is smoothed using the
    %suavgausiano function with a window of size 3.
    %To run this function you wont need the Image Processing Toolbox, but
    %you'll need it when you want to read the image and try to get its
    %histogram.
    %I hope this code can help you.
